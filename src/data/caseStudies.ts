    challenge: 'Sunny Side Plumbing relied heavily on word-of-mouth and expensive, untrackable print ads. They struggled to find a consistent stream of new, local homeowners in need of their services.',
    solution: 'We set up a Local Lead Bot campaign targeting three specific high-income zip codes. The bot was configured to identify social media posts and forum discussions related to plumbing emergencies and home renovations.',
    results: 'Within 90 days, Sunny Side Plumbing received over 150 qualified leads directly from the bot, a 300% increase over their previous monthly average. This led to 45 new customers and a 5x return on their investment.',

    challenge: 'The Corner Bistro had a popular weekend service but struggled to attract customers on Tuesday and Wednesday nights, leading to inconsistent revenue and food waste.',
    solution: 'A campaign was launched to monitor local food blogger activity and social media check-ins at nearby entertainment venues. The bot sent out targeted offers for "2-for-1 appetizers on weeknights" to these individuals.',
    results: 'The bistro saw a 40% increase in Tuesday and Wednesday traffic. The campaign directly contributed to filling an average of 15 extra tables per week, paying for the Local Lead Bot subscription in the first month.',
